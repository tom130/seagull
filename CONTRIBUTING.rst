How to Contribute
=================

This project has been receiving PRs and issue reports from people that have
made positive changes. These changes have been merged at a really slow pace.
Efforts are made to merge changes in a timely manner but it's not always
possible, primarily due to these reasons:

* The primary reason to create this repo was to get Seagull to build for my day job
* I am not using Seagull in my day job anymore

If you use Seagull regularly and are affected by the slow pace of handling
issues and PRs, contact me on Twitter (@aikchar) to add you as a contributor.
